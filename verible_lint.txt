# Configuration for the Verible lint tool
# Based on https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex/blob/master/vendor/lowrisc_ip/lint/tools/veriblelint/lowrisc-styleguide.rules.verible_lint

# allow localparams to be written in all caps with underscores,
# in addition to using camelcase
parameter-name-style=localparam_style:CamelCase|ALL_CAPS

# don't require generate blocks to have a label
-generate-label

# may want to revisit this at some point, but most parameters we're
# using are untyped, so this would be a major change
-explicit-parameter-storage-type
-explicit-function-task-parameter-type

# allow "always @*", since "always_comb" is not part of plain Verilog
-always-comb

# for now, don't require explicit static/automatic declaration on
# functions (not sure if this is even part of plain verilog)
-explicit-function-lifetime

# for now, allow $random
-invalid-system-task-function

# allow $test$plusargs
-plusarg-assignment

# need to waive this to allow macro usage (e.g., examples/axil/testbench.sv)
-module-port
