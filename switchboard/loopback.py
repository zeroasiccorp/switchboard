def umi_loopback(umi: UmiTxRx, packets: Union[Integral, Iterable, Iterator] = 10, **kwargs):
    """
    Performs a loopback test by sending packets into a block and checking that
    the packets received back are equivalent under the UMI split/merge rules.

    Parameters
    ----------
    umi: UmiTxRx
    packets:
        Can be a number, a list of packets, or a generator.

        - If this is a number, it represents the number of packets to send,
          which are generated with random_umi_packet. Any remaining arguments
          are passed directly to random_umi_packet.
        - If this is an iterable (list, tuple, etc.), then it represents a list
          of packets to use for the test.  This is helpful if you want to use a very
          specific sequence of transactions.
        - This can also be an iterator, which might be convenient if you want to
          send a very large number of packets without having to store them
          all in memory at once, e.g. (random_umi_packet() for _ in range(1000000))

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the number of packets is not positive or if the `packets` argument is empty
    Exception
        If a received packet does not match the corresponding transmitted packet
