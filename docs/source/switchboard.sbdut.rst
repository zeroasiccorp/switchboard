switchboard.sbdut module
========================

Note that the `sbdut` module inherits functions from `siliconcompiler.Chips`, such as `input()` used to add rtl files to the simulation and `add()` used to add include directories to the simulation. These functions are important for specifying the RTL files used in a simulation, but they are not covered in the documentation here. For a complete list of the the inherited functions, checkout the `siliconcompiler documentation <https://docs.siliconcompiler.com/en/stable/reference_manual/index.html>`_.
